Water footprint of crop production and consumption in China

Statistics on water footprints in crop production and consumption in mainland China.
The annual green and blue water footprints in production of 22 crops in China are shown at either 5x5 arc minute grid resolution or provincial average levels over 1961-2009.
The annual green and blue water footprints in consumption of the 22 crops are listed for provinces over 1961-2009.
